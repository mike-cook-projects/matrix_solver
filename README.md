Matrix Puzzle Solver
====================

Solves a matrix puzzle with the following conditions:  

  1. Each tile gives the point value on the tile
  2. Tiles marked "D" double the current point total
  3. Once crossed, a tile provides no additional points

With those requirements, this library solves a matrix of random	dimensions and starting point by showing the optimal route.
